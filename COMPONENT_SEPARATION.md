# Component Separation: Navbar and Hero

## Overview
The navbar and hero sections are now completely separated into independent components with proper styling and layout management.

## Component Structure

### 1. Navbar Component (`src/components/Navbar.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Navigation menu with dropdown functionality
- **Features**:
  - Fixed positioning (stays at top of viewport)
  - Scroll-based appearance changes (transparent to solid)
  - Responsive mobile menu
  - Dropdown submenus for About, Services, and Products
- **Styling**: `src/components/Navbar.css`
- **Dependencies**: None (self-contained)

### 2. Hero Component (`src/components/Hero.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main landing section with animated content
- **Features**:
  - Full viewport height (100vh)
  - Animated particles and decorative elements
  - Call-to-action buttons
  - Responsive design
- **Styling**: `src/components/Hero.css`
- **Dependencies**: None (self-contained)

## Layout Management

### App.js Structure
```jsx
<Router>
  <div className="App">
    <Navbar />
    <main className="main-content">
      <Hero />
    </main>
  </div>
</Router>
```

### Key Separation Features

1. **Independent Styling**: Each component has its own CSS file
2. **No Shared State**: Components don't share state or props
3. **Proper Z-index**: Navbar (z-index: 1000) overlays Hero content
4. **Responsive Design**: Each component handles its own responsive behavior
5. **Scroll Independence**: Navbar scroll behavior doesn't affect Hero layout

## CSS Organization

### Navbar.css
- Fixed positioning and overlay states
- Mobile menu functionality
- Glass morphism effects
- Dropdown animations

### Hero.css
- Full viewport layout
- Background gradients and animations
- Content positioning
- Responsive breakpoints

### App.css
- Main layout wrapper
- Content positioning
- Global styles

## Benefits of Separation

1. **Maintainability**: Each component can be modified independently
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used in different contexts
3. **Performance**: Independent rendering and styling
4. **Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation
5. **Development**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously

## Usage

Both components are imported and used in `App.js`:

```jsx
import Navbar from './components/Navbar';
import Hero from './components/Hero';
```

The components work together seamlessly while maintaining complete independence in terms of functionality and styling.
